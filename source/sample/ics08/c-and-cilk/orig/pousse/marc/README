Thanks to a power failure this afternoon I was able to test my theory
that a dry run would help your program run within the time limit.
Unfortunately it didn't change anything... so I really don't
understand what is happening.  I've attached the referee program
below.  Please try it out and let me know if you see anything that
could be causing the problem (especially in the turn()).  You have to
run the program as root and place entries in contestants/1/runme and
contestants/2/runme and enter the command:

   referee 6 1 2      i.e. N=6 and battle entries 1 and 2 (X=1 and O=2)

You also have to allocate user ids for entries 1 and 2 and change the
macro

#define uid(n)(3092+n)

so that it correctly maps entry numbers to user ids.
